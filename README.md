### Hej! I'm Kn√§ckepizza üëã
**NICK NETTLETON**

I'm a Fullstack Web Developer in Atlanta, Georgia. I'm only a Sophomore at Kennesaw State University, but I have almost 2 years of **ACTUAL** work experience doing web development. I have taught interns as well as people senior to me (how cool is that?). 

A few people I've worked for:
- Gretrix (Jul 2019)
- Seek Capital (Nov 2019)

A few large feats I've come across:
- TransUnion API Project
- Large Scale Dropshipping Store Management & Development

A few things that I do:
- Lots of PHP/MySQL
- Using SSH/FTP but also IIS
- Custom WordPress & Shopify Development *(and troubleshooting)*
- APIs (JSON & SOAP)

*Disclaimer: Not the actual brand Kn√§ckepizza.*
